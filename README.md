# Distributed Room Reservation System (DRRS) using Java RMI

In this assignment, I implemented a distributed room reservation system
(DRRS) for a university with multiple campuses: a distributed system used by administrators
who manage the availability information about the university’s rooms and students who can
reserve the rooms across the university’s different campuses.
